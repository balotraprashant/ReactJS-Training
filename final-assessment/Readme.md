Assessment Exercise
-------------------

Requirements: Movie Database App with Redux, API Integration, and Tailwind CSS

API Integration: Utilize a movie API such as The Movie Database API (TMDb) to fetch movie data. You'll need to sign up for an API key from TMDb to access their API.

Redux Integration: Manage the state of the application using Redux. Store movie data, search results, and any other relevant information in the Redux store. Use Redux actions and reducers to update the state based on user interactions.

Functionality:

1. Design a homepage for the Movies application to display the Brand Name "TTN-MDb" on the top left hand side and User Name / Image on the top right hand side.
2. On landing on the homepage the user should be able to see some default movies displayed on the homepage in a grid or list format, showing movie posters, titles, ratings, and other relevant information.
3. Allow users to search for movies by title, genre, or release year using a search bar or filters. Display search results in a grid or list format, showing movie posters, titles, ratings, and other relevant information.
4. Implement pagination or infinite scrolling to handle large sets of search results.
5. Enable users to view detailed information about a specific movie, including synopsis, cast, ratings, and related movies.
6. Provide navigation between different views/screens (e.g., search results, movie details) using React Router or a similar library.
7. Styling with Tailwind CSS: Use Tailwind CSS to style the components of your movie database application. Design a visually appealing user interface that is responsive and easy to navigate.

Additional Features (Optional):

1. Implement user authentication to allow users to save favorite movies or create watchlists.
2. Add sorting and filtering options to help users find movies more easily.
3. Incorporate animations or transitions to enhance the user experience.
4. Include a "popular movies" section or recommendations based on user preferences.

NOTE: The development should be carried out in using the mobile-first approach with maximum usage of tailwind class and minimum custom CSS.
